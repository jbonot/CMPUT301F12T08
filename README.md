Comput 301 Project

We should probably update this with stuff

Mike: Here's some stuff.

Katherine: Here is a line, hope it is visible

Jeanine:  Today I was walking outside and a guy yelled out really loud (to no one in particular?) about how much he doesn't like the weather.  It's not even raining that bad.  And it's not even cold.  He's crazy.  Crazy I tell you!

Anyway, it took me a while to re-figure this out.  Don't worry though.  If you can see this, I must have done something right.
